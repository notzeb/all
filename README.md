I'm trying to collect all my notes in one place, in as open a format as possible.

I view these notes as my own personalized form of wikipedia's math pages: wikipedia's math pages are a great resource, but they never present things the way I would present them to myself. Latex code doesn't take much hard drive space, so it seems reasonable for every mathematician to maintain their own personalized compilation of the foundations of math, with their favorite clever (or straightforward) proofs of whichever results they think are most fundamental or interesting.

However, if every mathematician were to write out their own personal Bourbaki from scratch, then there would be a huge amount of duplicated effort. My suggestion is for anyone who embarks on such a project to make their latex code publicly available, and to feel free to copy the latex code for results that they have no special insight on from others. Since notes are frequently updated, it may not make sense to post these projects to the arxiv - so I'm trying github as a repository, instead.

My personal style of writing notes probably won't fit most people's tastes. If you think that my notes would be improved by being more verbose, or being more organized, or by including more examples, or better pictures: please feel free to copy them and change them to your liking!

A very similar project can be found at https://github.com/vEnhance/napkin - he's done a much better job than me, actually (mine are at best 10% of the way to where I want them, his seem almost finished - thankfully it isn't a competition). Another similar project is the stacks project: https://github.com/stacks/stacks-project - it certainly seems like people find github a natural repository for these things!

# CSP notes

The notes I'm currently actively working on are the notes on constraint satisfaction problems, which you can download directly via the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notzeb/all/master/csp-notes.pdf. These notes contain some material which hasn't been published.
