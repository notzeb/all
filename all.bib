abstract = {Many combinatorial search problems can be expressed as âconstraint satisfaction problemsâ and this class of problems is known to be NP-complete in general. In this paper, we investigate the subclasses that arise from restricting the possible constraint types. We first show that any set of constraints that does not give rise to an NP-complete class of problems must satisfy a certain type of algebraic closure condition. We then investigate all the different possible forms of this algebraic closure property, and establish which of these are sufficient to ensure tractability. As examples, we show that all known classes of tractable constraints over finite domains can be characterized by such an algebraic closure property. Finally, we describe a simple computational procedure that can be used to determine the closure properties of a given set of constraints. This procedure involves solving a particular constraint satisfaction problem, which we call an âindicator problem.â},

Together with known results this gives a trichotomy: a CSP has either relational width 1, or relational width (2,3) (and no smaller relational width), or does not have bounded relational width.A consequence of this result is that if Î is a finite constraint language containing relations of arity at most k, then the CSP over Î either cannot be solved by a Datalog program, or can be solved by a Datalog program consisting of rules with at most max{3,k} variables and at most 2 variables in the head.},

In this article, we study arc consistency, a heavily investigated inference method, and three extensions thereof from the perspective of constraint languages. We conduct a comparison of the studied methods on the basis of which constraint languages they solve, and we present new polynomial-time tractability results for singleton arc consistency, the most powerful method studied.},

As a consequence, we obtain efficient algorithms for recognizing affine and quasi-affine quandles, and we enumerate small quasi-affine quandles. We also prove that the âabelian implies quasi-affineâ problem of universal algebra has affirmative answer for the class of quandles."

abstract = {In a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), the aim is to find an assignment of values to a given set of variables, subject to specified constraints. The CSP is known to be NP-complete in general. However, certain restrictions on the form of the allowed constraints can lead to problems solvable in polynomial time. Such restrictions are usually imposed by specifying a constraint language, that is, a set of relations that are allowed to be used as constraints. A principal research direction aims to distinguish those constraint languages that give rise to tractable CSPs from those that do not.We achieve this goal for the important version of the CSP, in which the set of values for each individual variable can be restricted arbitrarily. Restrictions of this type can be studied by considering those constraint languages which contain all possible unary constraints; we call such languages conservative. We completely characterize conservative constraint languages that give rise to polynomial time solvable CSP classes. In particular, this result allows us to obtain a complete description of those (directed) graphs H for which the List H-Coloring problem is solvable in polynomial time. The result, the solving algorithm, and the proofs heavily use the algebraic approach to CSP developed in Jeavons et al. [1997], Jeavons [1998], Bulatov et al. [2005], and Bulatov and Jeavons [2001b, 2003].},

abstract = {Conservative constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) constitute an important particular case of the general CSP, in which the allowed values of each variable can be restricted in an arbitrary way. Problems of this type are well studied for graph homomorphisms. A dichotomy theorem characterizing conservative CSPs solvable in polynomial time and proving that the remaining ones are NP-complete was proved by Bulatov (2003) in [4]. Its proof, however, is quite long and technical. A shorter proof of this result based on the absorbing subuniverses technique was suggested by Barto (2011) in [1]. In this paper we give a short elementary proof of the dichotomy theorem for conservative CSPs.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The chapter explores the number of clones containing all constants over a finite set A with |A| > 2. For |A| = 2, the answer is well known; one can easily check that the number of such clones is 7. For |A| > 2, 20 clones containing all constants are constructed. The chapter presents a theorem that states that there are 20 clones containing all constants over a finite set A with |A| > 2. It also presents an assumption in which |A| = k > 2 and A = {0, 1, â¦, k â 1}, where the set of all constant functions over A is denoted by C (A). If F is a set of functions over A, then [F] will denote the clone generated by F.}

abstract="We prove that every congruence distributive variety has directed J{\'o}nsson terms, and every congruence modular variety has directed Gumm terms. The directed terms we construct witness every case of absorption witnessed by the original J{\'o}nsson or Gumm terms. This result is equivalent to a pair of claims about absorption for admissible preorders in congruence distributive and congruence modular varieties, respectively. For finite algebras, these absorption theorems have already seen significant applications, but until now, it was not clear if the theorems hold for general algebras as well. Our method also yields a novel proof of a result by P. Lipparini about the existence of a chain of terms (which we call Pixley terms) in varieties that are at the same time congruence distributive and k-permutable for some k.",

abstract="Valiant (1984) and others have studied the problem of learning various classes of Boolean functions from examples. Here we discuss incremental learning of these functions. We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space.",

Also, we show that if there exist one-way functions that cannot be inverted by polynomial-sized circuits, then CNF or DNF formulas and convex polytopes intersected with the Boolean hypercube are either polynomial time predictable without membership queries, or they are not polynomial time predictable even with membership queries; so, in effect, membership queries will not help with predicting CNF or DNF formulas."

The characterization is tight and purely combinatorial. Our first application of this result is a surprising proof that the minimum space of refuting a 3-CNF formula is always bounded from below by the minimum width of refuting it (minus 3). This solves a well-known open problem. The second application is the unification of several width lower bound arguments, and a new width lower bound for the dense linear order principle. Since we also show that this principle has resolution refutations of polynomial size, this provides yet another example showing that the relationship between size and width cannot be made subpolynomial."

It follows that for a fixed finite set $A$, the set of all such Malcev clones is countable. This completes the solution of a problem that was first formulated in 1980, or earlier: how many Malcev clones can finite sets support? More generally, we prove that every finite algebra with few subpowers has a finitely related clone of term operations. Hence modulo term equivalence and a renaming of the elements, there are only countably many finite algebras with few subpowers, and thus only countably many finite algebras with a Malcev term.},

abstract = "We study maximum cardinality families of pairwise intersecting subsets of an n-set. We give some general results on the collection of all such families for a fixed set and introduce a useful operation of switching which allows us to transform any one such family to another. We use this operation to determine all possibilities for n = 6, and to answer two open questions on families which are regular (as hypergraphs). Although there are no regular maximal intersecting families for n = 2, 4, 8 there are for all larger powers of two. We also determine sharp bounds for the largest size of a regular maximal intersecting family with a member of size a."

We investigate some homomorphism properties of cores and conclude that it is NP-complete to decide whether or not a graph is its own core. (A similar conclusion is reached about testing whether or not a graph is rigid, i.e., admits a non-identity homomorphism to itself.) We also give a polynomial-time verifiable condition for a graph of small independence number to be its own core."

abstract = "We study the approximability of (Finite-)Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems (VCSPs) with a fixed finite constraint language Î consisting of finitary functions on a fixed finite domain. Ene et al. have shown that, under a mild technical condition, the basic LP relaxation is optimal for constant-factor approximation for VCSP(Î) unless the Unique Games Conjecture fails. Using the algebraic approach to the CSP, we give new natural algebraic conditions for the finiteness of the integrality gap for the basic LP relaxation of VCSP(Î) and show how this leads to efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms for several examples that cover all previously known cases that are NP-hard to solve to optimality but admit constant-factor approximation. Finally, we show that the absence of another algebraic condition leads to NP-hardness of constant-factor approximation. Thus, our results indicate where the boundary of constant-factor approximability for VCSPs lies."
